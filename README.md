**`A full-stack software engineer, born and raised in Puerto Rico!`**
<hr>
<p>I love challenges. I love going beyond the limits that I unconsciously set for myself out of fear, weakness, and ignorance, and realizing that if I really want something, when there is a will, there is a way. Having a professional background in Real Estate, and also having been able to spend the year of 2021 living in a Monastery in California because of my deep interest in meditation and spiritual philosophy, I bring to the table my ability to build meaningful and respectful relationships with others, my ability to keep great attention to detail, and to focus and concentrate deeply on my tasks at hand.</p>
<br>
<p>My desire to keep learning and growing as a developer doesnâ€™t cease and I know that it will only increase with time. My diverse background, the drive, the passion, and the enthusiasm I feel for learning and improving my engineering skills give me confidence in my ability to reach my full potential as a software engineer and to build great software.</p>
